Anna Berzins- Achievement House Cyber Charter School,"Some ways we can ensure student engagement in the transition planning and IEP process is by tailoring the whole conversation to the student, providing multiple opportunities for student and family involvement, and by empowering them to lead the IEP conversation.

Students should not just be invited to the IEP meeting, but they should have an active role in the IEP. Students should also be treated as a VIP throughout the process. The case manager should facilitate the meeting in a way that is student friendly and engages the student by asking questions and inviting them to discuss their academic and functional goals, and provide their valuable input. They should be encouraged to guide the conversation and self advocate with the rest of the IEP team's support. For example, the student should be given opportunities to discuss their post-secondary goals and what supports benefit them at school. As stated in the video, teachers could encourage students to share a vision board, create a PowerPoint, a YouTube video, and share it with the IEP team during the meeting. Students can share what works well and what does not work well when it comes to a classroom setting and take advantage of the supports in a school setting. If students are currently working, they can share pictures from an internship/work setting. The key is to ensure students are properly prepared for the IEP before coming to  the meeting and playing an active role.

Since the IEP is telling a story, each part of the IEP should relate to a student's transition goals. The student gets to take an active role in discussing these plans and making sure that they feel comfortable with the direction in which the IEP team is moving. The student should be given time to speak, and if they're not able to be present, then at least participate as much as possible before/after the IEP meeting.

When student and family input is woven throughout the whole fabric of the IEP, only then is the IEP truly engaging students and empowering them to make educational decisions that will help them in school and beyond.

Dinah Lapp - Juniata Valley School District,"Just as the title ""IEP"" suggests, an individual education plan is a collection of strategies centered entirely around an individual so it makes sense that said individual would be involved in the planning. Students should be offered the opportunity to share their input, desires, interests, and needs for themselves with the rest of the IEP team as they all work collaboratively. As the tips in the video mention, this input could be portrayed in a way that interests and is comfortable for students as well. Even if they would like to share privately with an adult prior to the meeting for the adult to share and their ideas to be heard. Nobody knows the student better than the student themself. Opportunity for them to share that knowledge should be given again and again.

"Justin Walter, Jamestown School District, Gary Kinnear (LEA)","Student engagement is very important during the process of transition planning and the IEP process. Student involvement is a key piece in developing successful planning of the two. Engaging the student in these processes are on-going and should be reviewed continually in order for it to be individualized and reflective of the student. Some ways to engage the student is through interactions and to meet with them prior to an IEP meeting. Also, tools like interest inventories can be another way to engage and get to know the student interest better. I believe it is important to show a student his/her progress thus far along with all of their accomplishments. I believe it is very important for the student to feel comfortable with the supports they have and understand what supports they have and who is helping from the IEP team.   To increase student engagement during these processes is to have open conversations with the students and support them so that they feel empowered and think an IEP to be positive and helpful in their education.

"Lizette Quintana - EEACS, Allentown, PA","Student engagement in the IEP process and transition planning is easier to begin as early as possible. When a student is approaching transition service age, best practice to preview as much about planning for the future and stress the importance of the student’s perspective as you can. Encouraging the student to be honest and express confidence with their plans for future is a great way to ensure the student stays active in their IEP. It also starts to develop skills that will influence their participation in other areas. With an IEP team, a student should be able to comfortably express their goals and be able to work constructively with a group of people to develop activities to support their post secondary goals. Allowing the student to prepare and share during their IEP meeting is a great opportunity to practice leadership skills and since it directly connects to their interest and future, they should feel a strong passion and connection to what they may be presenting. A good idea would be for an IEP student to share about their experience with a transition assessment or activity or to research and present a service or activity that will help them achieve their goal.

Having students take a role in the process of how the meeting should run is one way they can be involved.  Another way a student can be involved in the process is having the student come up with an agenda and lead the meeting.  I think teaching the student that they are an important team member along with everyone else is also huge.  I really liked the suggestion of having the student come up with a recording or a powerpoint presentation describing their likes/dislikes or career interests.  I think giving a student some autonomy in how they give their presentation to the IEP team can also create some confidence that can carry over into other aspects of their life.

Building a good rapport with a student is key. Making them feel that their opinion and what they have to say is important will give them the confidence to speak up more often about what they like/dislike, what is helping and not helping them, etc. I feel that directly asking students questions during an IEP meeting to engage them in the process would be beneficial.

One could possibly do many things to increase student engagement in both the transition phases and IEP Process.  Perhaps increasing more informal building bonds between various people in his or her IEP Team.  Increasing informal conversations that keep the student engaged in his or her own goals.  The student may convey key aspects in helping him or her in their own goals, as students may have different demeanors in different settings.  Opportunities  for students to take leadership roles could arise in circumstances such as promoting participation of the actual student.  I particularly liked the opportunity to have them open meetings with slide shows, etc.  Giving the student the opportunity to tell everyone else what is working, and what not may be working, and perhaps taking more of their suggestions.  Keeping assessments recent and adjusting them is also key!

Being involved in a meeting where you may not know all of the participants and do not understand what is occurring can be overwhelming. Students can be provided time prior to the meeting to watch videos and discuss with peers what occurs during an IEP meeting. This will help increase their comfort level and facilitate their increased involvement. It is also important to ensure that parents understand the importance and reasoning for student performance in the IEP meeting. An easy first step is to have the student introduce themselves and the team members they know, including their parent(s).

We can ensure student engagement in the IEP process by keeping the students updated each step of the process. Not only should they be involved in their IEP meeting, but they should be directly taught to self-advocate for themselves by fully understanding their IEP. If we teach students about the IEP and how/why it is written, they will be more inclined to speak up for themselves. I loved the ideas that were presented to the students in the video; providing them with different ways that they could speak up during the meeting, i.e. power point, instagram pictures, making a video, etc. These techniques will assist the students in feeling more comfortable talking about themselves and advocating for what they want to do in the future.

The Present Levels section of the IEP, if it is completed correctly and thoroughly, sets the stage for the success of the IEP. Information needs to come from all sources but especially from the student.

Michelle Hall - ECASD (Leslie Gleghorn),"The answer to this question is based more on an ideal world than reality. Nonetheless, having a student contribute their strengths and present their transition goals in a format that suits them is best. A student could make a powerpoint, write it down, create a video, or show pictures at the meeting to help convey the information they share. They could explain where they struggle in certain situations or classes to help guide modifications options. 


Feeling comfortable at one’s own IEP meetings can be a challenging task. 
First, the student attends with a group of adults and professionals, who are in decision-making roles in their lives. They are used to trusting their decisions and following their lead. It is not easy to go from being the child or student outside the meeting, to feeling that their say is important at the meeting. 
Second, the IEP itself is like a magnifying glass into their lives. It focuses on more than the normal academics, and looks at their living skills at home as well. It has more than just scores, but also opinions and interpretations. On top of that, everyone on the IEP team has a hand in this document that highlights struggles and challenges of this student and breaks them down and then determines how to address all of them. It could feel invasive and judgemental.
Then we ask the student to feel comfortable and that it is a chance to self-advocate and that their opinion is important. But this student is a child placed in a vulnerable situation and it is no wonder many do not have much to say. 
I go through students’ IEPs at the beginning of every year with my students. Consistently, students indicate they feel left out from the process, they are not comfortable at the meeting, and not knowledgeable of the information written about them. 


To have time dedicated during the day that is not constrained by parent’s work and availability, having substitutes for special education and regular education teachers (and their prior lesson planning to missing class and their time away from other students), LEA schedule, agency schedules, and the student once again missing class. Ideally, having a student review the draft IEP prior to the meeting and provide input there would be wonderful. But we have to consider that districts are currently short staffed, so if they pull this student, they are away from working with other students. Additionally, the student has already been pulled for testing and to collect data, so we would again be taking an academically struggling student out of their academic classes. And will be again, for the meeting. It is constantly a balance of pros and cons and whether the pro outweighs all the other resulting cons.

Student should be provided with opportunities to explore their interests in academic and non academic classes and then reflect on where they feel they have strengths and areas where they might need more support to make this transition sucessful.

Having an established and trusted relationship can help facilitate successful ongoing communication via conversations, surveys, interviews, check ins, and meetings that allow for the student to have an active role in their transition planning and for them to understand the importance of their input. Creating this open and ongoing line of communication can help establish the feeling for the student that they have the ability to advocate for themselves and take the lead in parts of the planning process for their IEP and transition services.

First, I think students need to be aware of and have an understanding of their disability, the purpose of an IEP and how it can support them. This can be a difficult conversation to have, but if a student isn't part of this conversation then there definitely won't be any engagement. Directing questions to the student rather than to the teachers or family members is imperative in them becoming a leader in their planning and success. When I first started in the district, I sat in IEP meetings where a former colleague had the student's basically run the IEP and I found that to be both profound and beneficial.

I believe the first and most important step of engaging a student in their IEP process is helping them understand what goals they are working towards, and how transition activities should relate directly to their future. Many times students can look at our transition and academic interventions as busy work, and they struggle to make an independent connection with these activities and how they are actually designed to help prepare them for life after high school. Helping them develop a healthy balance of focusing both on current school work and future planning is essential. I believe all students of high school age should be present at their IEP meetings, should be spoken to as a member of the IEP team, and should take part in conversations with the OVR representative.

They will most likely answer because they like to help people. Inform them of all types of occupations that help people.

Student involvement should increase and change each year depending on the students goals.  Involvement should begin with interviews and discussions of data that has been collected by the IEP team.  With this data the case manager/ transition plan coordinator can discuss the students desired outcomes for his/her future.  It should also lead to a more customized IEP that reflects what they perceive are their strengths and weaknesses and what SDI and modifications they view as valuable and needed to be successful.  As the student becomes more involved and comfortable with their IEP, their role as a leader will become easier for them.  Another way for the student to become more engaged in their IEP meeting is to have them find a desirable way to present their thoughts to the team (power point, artwork, tik tok video, etc) that does not cause too much anxiety.

Maureen Donlevy Smith-West Shore School District,"Students should take an active role in their IEP meeting in the high school.  I explain their participation to students as, ""I can't choose for you, you must choose for yourself.""  It is more helpful to have students express their interests, respond to questions and participate in a discussion.  When the students realize they will not be grilled, they usually warm up and participate.  I find that you need to prepare them for this part.  Talking to a table full of adults is probably a scary idea.  Also, they have to be able to express their wishes and that might be uncomfortable as well.  Having discussions and preparing the students prior really goes a long way.  A video is a nice idea, but I think that might confound the kids rather than help them.  None of them liked being on camera for zoom and a flipgrid is just as unpopular.

One of the first ways is to engage the student in conversation about what they see themselves doing in the future. Talk about the different options to achieve that goal. Give the student a career inventory questionnaire if they are unsure of what they might want to do, post graduation. Find volunteer/paid opportunities in that career, so the student is familiar with what it takes and/or decide if they really like this path. Having a course in the High School Curriculum geared towards the process of gaining employment or post secondary education would help develop these goals. Students during this class could be informed of how the IEP process works as well as educated on their specific disability and how this might effect them in the post graduation world. Students should be invited to the IEP meeting as well as give feedback about how the modifications are helping them or ways they are using them to access the curriculum more effectively for themselves. Students can be the leader in their IEP process and advocate for themselves which would be beneficial for them when they complete high school.

For example, after a variety of assessments with a career plan in mind, the student can be provided a list of courses the school offers that allow them to choose which ones best align with their career path.  In addition, this also is needed when considering service activities for the transition goals.  Asking probing questions as to what areas the student would like to work, which companies they might find interesting to investigate, and what questions they might have for professionals would give the student readiness tools for job shadowing opportunities.  Then, instead of school personnel contacting these facilities, teachers work with the student on how to make a professional phone call or write a professional e-mail to request a job shadowing opportunity.  After, the student is responsible for contacting the agencies themselves.  This is also true for requesting OVR services, seeking a university tour, or requesting more information on an apartment.  Students should be the ones to take the lead with the support of school personnel.  Another way to engage students in the process is for them to create a presentation on their journey to their future career.  This could include information on what surveys they took, what the results included, how these results assisted them to take the next step, what they are currently doing to complete their goals, and what questions or things are they thinking in a reflection after.

One way to keep students engaged in the transition and IEP process is to use student-friendly language when discussing their IEP. Students feel intimidated and confused when adults speak about data and paperwork that is ""over their heads"". It is also important to mentally prepare students to be able to speak up at these meetings. They need to be ensured that their voice matters, that is it is okay to disagree with the adults, and that we are there to support them.

For the next IEP meeting, I may encourage that student to talk by asking them direct questions about their interests, hobbies, what they like to do after school, or ask if they want to tell us some of their future plans.  

It is important as the IEP case manager to establish trust with the student, maintain a good rapport, and encourage and nurture the student to the point where they can start to open up more and feel more comfortable at their own IEP meeting.  Ownership is important to our young adults and it's important that we talk with them and involve them without talking at them or throwing them into the deep end to let them sink or swim by putting them on the spot at an IEP meeting. These meetings can be very intimating for students and parents.  We do not want to make attending an IEP a negative experience for someone.  As a result, Special Education teachers and IEP case managers need to get to know their students very well.  If you have that one very outgoing student who feels comfortable talking in class, then ask them if they would like to help lead, or make a poster, Powerpoint or video about their interests, career goals, or their vision for post-secondary education or training.

In order to prepare students for participation and being leaders in their own IEP meetings, a way to increase this engagement and prepare students for what this looks like is to practice self-advocacy sessions for students who are nearing transition age. Ways to increase student engagement for students who participate in their own IEPs is to find ways that already tap into their individual learning styles. For example, a student could do a video or audio recording explaining their goals for themselves, what they like/dislike about school, strengths, etc. Students could also do things like give a small presentation, a presentation, or write their thoughts as long as it appeals to the students' interests and they are comfortable with the method of delivery which promotes engagement and gives the student a chance to be a leader.

Students go from not being involved in IEP team meetings to be invited as they become age 14.  However, they don't always have the necessary skills to be an active participant in the meetings.

There are many ways a student can be involved in their IEP meeting.  It depends on the student as to how involved they are.  Involvement must start with preparation before the meeting - an in-depth conversation with their IEP case manager or transition coordinator and work with them to determine how they would like to be involved in the IEP meeting.

Before we begin to include students in the transition planning process, we need to make sure that we know our students really well by building and sustaining positive relationships with them and their families.  Even before they reach 14 years of age, we can start to invite them to IEP meetings so we can hear from them about their strengths and weaknesses, interests and goals for the future.  Additionally, parent input forms and surveys bring a great deal of information about the students’ goals and dreams.

The first step to increase student engagement in their transition planning and IEP process is to invite the student to their IEP meetings. Prior to the meeting someone on the IEP team, whom they have rapport with, can mentor and help them prepare for the meeting. The involvement will look different for each student and overtime they may start to feel more comfortable to lead more components. Like the video mentioned, they could prepare for the meeting by creating a list of what they would like to mention, a slideshow or even a video.

Student-directed IEP meetings would be a great way for students to practice their self-advocacy skills and a huge first step to have student voice be heard at the meeting. If an LEA had a continuum in place for Student-directed IEP meetings to take place, each year (in theory) the student would get better and better at speaking in front of others - something that almost any student can benefit from.
The pre-meeting practice and post-meeting debrief would also be great practices that could benefit a student going for a job interview, or trying to get into college. It would also allow for open honest discussion at the meeting no matter the level of the student's disability and allow for all persons: teachers, parents and agency staff to observe the individual ""in action"" and allow for their wishes to drive the course of action outlined in the IEP.

We can ensure and increase student engagement in all aspects of the IEP so long as they are able to communicate.  Students should become familiar with their goals and expectations and they should be allowed to provide feedback - what's working, what isn't and what would be helpful etc.  

For the purpose of transition, some students are acutely aware of the interests, while others maybe thinking with some having no clue.  What CMs can do is to share with students what they are doing, why they are doing and why it matters.  With that approach, students can reflect on their likes and dislikes and further narrow it using various inventories, exploration of career interests and what it will take to get there.  Their interests can be tied to their academics so they may see the relationship between what they are doing in the classroom, and what they are interested in doing after high school.  The  overall goal is to engage throughout the process and letting the student know that their input with guidance is in their best interest.

Time with the student should be set aside prior to the IEP meeting, to help prepare the student, as well as having a debrief session with the student after the meeting. Soliciting the student’s input for their IEP is crucial; while parents/guardians typically have solid knowledge of what a student wants for his/her life, it is the student him/herself who can (and should be encouraged to) speak most directly about what is in his/her heart and head with regard to postsecondary goals and ambitions, which further solidifies the IEP and IEP meeting being student- / person focused.

I feel that in order to ensure / increase student engagement in the transition planning and IEP process, we need to consider involving the student in their educational programming the during the entire year, not just around the time of the actual IEP Meeting.  Students should have a good relationship with their Case Manager first and foremost and by the time they are transition age, they should also understand their Disability as well.  Furthermore, understanding their IEP Goals (and Objectives if applicable), SDI's, Transition Section, and more are all important things they should have a grasp of prior to the actual IEP meeting.  Once the above is in place, then a student will be already invested in their educational programming and having them take a leadership role via some of the examples the module listed (PowerPoint, YouTube Video, facilitator of the meeting, etc.) will all come naturally.
