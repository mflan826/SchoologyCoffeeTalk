# SchoologyCoffeeTalk
#This script is used by the Edu Consultants to identify the LEA of each participant in the "Coffee Talks" (Padlets) in the I13 Schoology courses. There are 500+ individuals and 7 different Padlets they are using. The data is exported from the Padlets, run through the script and a csv is exported containing the following fields - participation ID, the title of their post, body of the post, date that they last updated their post, LEA, Region. Grepl is used to find the LEA names within the subject and body fields of the orginal data. Based upon the LEA, a region is assigned.
