Using the “Assessment Connection Grid” can help us identify what gaps of post-secondary, employment, and independent living information are we missing that is necessary to drive post-secondary measurable annual goals relating to transition? We can help identify what assessments would be appropriate based on these gaps of information in correlation with what the student wants to achieve after high school. Are results valued? This is a pivotal question that is oftentimes missed in the process. An assessment completed without review and application of the results to the existing transition plan then serves no point. It’s essential to view the transition assessment process not one that occurs one time per year prior to the annual IEP meeting, but an ongoing process that each step is based off of the previous results. Oftentimes school districts will administer the same formal assessments every year without valuing and applying the data to the transition plan, future assessments, goals, services, and activities. Ongoing transition planning meetings should occur, and data should be shared upon completion of each assessment. Action steps should be decided upon reviewing the results of each assessment to continue to progress toward the students’ transition goals.

However, being creative in utilizing the interests and wants of the student is key.

We can ensure that student’s transition assessment results produce MPSGs that are in alignment by including the student in each step of the process.  They need to know that we are here to facilitate their future goals and make sure they have the correct courses, agency assistance, and supports to help them achieve their career goals.  By using appropriate, on-going assessments, we can monitor and adapt the student’s goals to move them closer to meeting their anticipated outcome.

Selecting  transition assessments that are appropriate for the student is very important.  Each assessment no matter if formal or informal must help provide answers to one or more of the transition plan domains. Without proper data it is impossible to create MPSGs that are in alignment with the students preferences and future transition goals.  To help all members of the transition team to be engaged during this ongoing process, communication and data access is key.  The student with guidance from his/her transition team should be collecting and organizing his/her data in a way that leads to meaningful discussion about the student’s future goals and the needs that are required to be meant to achieve them.

To include and support students and their parents/family school should involve them in all aspects of the IEP process and ensure student and parent/family interviews are part of the informal assessment process.  Also, students can help with the creation and maintenance of documentation portfolios.  This approach provides increased ownership and the likelihood that the MPSGs will align with the student's preferences and plans.

As students age, it is important that the assessments help narrow their field of interest and guide them on their career path. This information will help the team plan transition services from activities to courses and services the student will need while attending school and after graduation.


Parental involvement as well as student involvement is the key in planning transition services. Information garnered during informal assessments are as valuable as formal assessments. This is where you get to know your student as an individual. What your student likes and does not like; what their strengths and weaknesses are and they things that they have accomplished and plan on doing.

There are many ways that we can ensure that the transition plans aligns with the students future plan. When you know your student well, you are better able to focus on their needs. This can come from informal observations, data collection, conversations with the student, parent and other teachers.  Transition assessments should also be used to help with this.  We need to remember that teenagers do change their minds and we need to keep up with them so that their goals are appropriate for them. 

We can include and support students, parents/family members, school personnel engagement in the transition assessment in several different ways. Students are included in the ongoing conversations throughout the year concerning transition. They also complete different transition activities throughout the school year, which include formal and informal inventories.   Parents are also  involved in the ongoing conversations concerning their student. Their information is included in the parent input section of the IEP.

The biggest stakeholders other than the students themselves are their parents.

If gaps are present, then we can use another assessment tool or attempt to be creative in finding the information needed to facilitate transition planning. 

Informal interviews and surveys with the student and parents can be utilized to create an environment where the student and parents feel invited to share information openly. The student survey can be done ahead of time in a 1:1 setting without the pressure of attending a larger meeting and speaking in front of a group if that would increase the comfort level for the student. School personnel need to be involved as well, by having all stakeholders on the same page the student has the opportunity to be exposed and experience activities that can confirm or question potential transition outcomes.

For example, if a student knows they want to enter the workforce directly after graduating from high school to work either in retail or the food service industry, we can discuss and provide job shadowing or work-based learning experiences in each of these career-interest areas in order for the student to get a better ""feel"" as to what each industry is like and make a better, more-informed decisions as to where they want to obtain employment after graduating from high school.

Including various members of the team will depend on regular communication, data collection, observation, checking in with the student.

It is important for MPSG's to align with what is written in the student's IEP.  There is an area in the Present Levels, Transition Section, Goals, and SDI where this alignment should happen.  If something is off, it can effect the supports provided which can cause these future plans a student establish to veer off course.
Students and families should be involved with results from interest finders, course scheduling, job shadowing, or job training.  It is important to find supports and facilities that align with the families belief's and student's life aspirations.

We need to utilize a students transition assessment to support their desired future outcomes.  The information provided by the student may not be what we would expect the student to do in the future.  We, as educators, need to take the student's information and assist them in looking at the future with realistic expectations and goals developed.  We need to work with the student's planning and review what is needed to reach their goals.  With this information from the student and with teaching and guidance involved, realistic goals can be written.

There are many ways in which we can support others during the transition process.   To me, it is very important to be open and honest about a student's skills and abilities.  Transparent communication with all involved will allow for the team to work together and do what is best for the student.

Stakeholders can be included and engaged by inviting them to IEP meetings, through progress monitoring, reaching out during open house, Career Fairs, community-based field trips, etc.

Future plans should always be fluid. I do not know how many of us are doing what we thought we would be doing at age 14, or even 18 but I certainly am not a lawyer or a music teacher! Our support as Educators should guide the student into providing them with as much information as possible to help them with their wishes.And that, can take time in the course of a school schedule. 
I don't know if there is one standard way to ensure that this can happen, but if a school district had a practice of looking over that Transition Assessment data at regular intervals during the year, perhaps that practice would help to inform instruction more ""deeply""? Even just a verbal check-in related to Assessment data would let the student and parent know that the school district is ""thinking about them"" and I definitely feel that the Family Engagement piece is a natural extension of Secondary Transition, and just goes with the job.

Using a variety of assessments will help to ensure that MPSGs are aligned to preferences, future plans and dreams. The specific tool selected should take into consideration the student's age and what part of the process they are in. For example, a junior who has clearly defined career outcomes would not likely be given a preference assessment, but a student turning 14 might be given this type of survey.
What are some ways we can include and support students, parents/family members, school personnel engagement in the transition assessment on-going process?

One way to engage all team members is to have open dialog during the IEP meeting to ensure every understands the purpose of both formal and informal assessments.

A variety of viewpoints and perspectives also help to capture all aspects of the students. Each member of the team has valuable information to share including the student.

It is important to ensure that the transition assessment process is ongoing.  As members of a student’s IEP team, we should expect that student interests and goals for themselves are going to change over time.  By using varied formal and informal transition assessments throughout the year, we are able to gather information to support students in developing a plan to achieve their goals.  It is also important to include families in the transition assessment process through surveys and interviews.  The results of transition assessments should be communicated with all members of the IEP team so that as a team, we can consistently support the needs of the student.     – Katelyn Emory

What are some ways we can ensure that students’ transition assessment results produce MPSGs that are in alignment with their preferences, future plans, and dreams? 
A variety of assessments should be utilized to address transition needs. Interest inventories, independent living skills inventories, ONET profilers, learning styles, and more. This will help students and their parents to truly understand where their child is at and the steps needed to acquire their goals. 
 
What are some ways we can include and support students, parents/family members, school personnel engagement in the transition assessment on-going process? 
  Student and parent transition surveys/checklists must be used to gather data each year. Involve students and parents in quarterly meetings with service providers. Provide flyers/information to families regarding transition opportunities.

Some ways that we can ensure  that students’ transition assessment results produce MPSGs that are in alignment with their preferences, future plans and dreams are through formal and informal ongoing transitioning assessments. This includes conversations and meetings with the student and family to help to write goals that assist with the development of independence. Surveys and interest profiles can be used to gather information about interests, vocational interests, and preferences. Measures can include learning characteristics, critical thinking skills. At our school we hold career/college fairs and speak with students and families about options this involves the community and connects the school environment. Our career and college center shares information with the school and invites students to come in for free workshops and assessments.  Surveys are also sent home to families to share observations, concerns, goals and any other information relevant to transition. Having a variety of ways to engage and assess hopefully helps to produces MPSGs that align with student preferences and dreams.--- Maisha Utterbach, ASD, Allentown, PA.

"","Danielle Sommers- To ensure alignment of preferences, we should check for consistency across assessments whether formal or informal. For example, if a student indicate on one assessment that they enjoy working outside but on another assessment the student indicates that he has no outdoor working skills, we would need to get some clarification on that particular item. Also, simply asking the student what they think about whether the MPSGs fit in to their goals and interests goes a long way to ensuring student investment in the transition process. As long as the student is able to communicate, he/she should be able to indicate whether these goals line up with their own. We can support students by checking in regularly with how they are doing in classes or activities related to their areas of interest.  It is also helpful to provide a list of resources to families that will allow the student to explore their interests outside of the daily school setting.  For example, if a student expresses interest in working with animals as a career, perhaps knowing local shelters that need volunteers would give students an opportunity to explore that particular interest.

In terms of ensuring that students' Transition assessment results produce measurable post secondary goals that are in alignment with their preferences, future plans, and dreams I feel we must make sure the assessment we provide the student is appropriate.  Many LEAs have Transition scope and sequence documents that outline what assessment will be given in 7th grade, 8th grade, etc.  This may be applicable for some, but for other students (who may have more cognitive delays, etc), the assessment must be appropriate so the outcome is warranted.  Furthermore, I feel that by involving aspects of information collected through PA 339 and ESSA, these artifacts may help with a students' overall Transition planning.  Finally, involving the student, family members, District personnel, and Community Agency representatives during Transition Staffing Meetings is a great way to continue this engagement process - making sure Transition is always ongoing.
