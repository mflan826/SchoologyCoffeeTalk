If a student says they want to be a doctor but is reading at a first grade level and cant do basic math, college and then medical school to become a doctor is unrealistic; however, if they are passionate about helping people there are numerous jobs they can be good at doing, such as working in a nursing home and helping to take care of ill people. They can be an aide, which is just minimal to no schooling for those that struggle with academics.

There are numerous ways in which one could make efforts to ensure transition assessment aligns with students future ambitions and dreams.  One is using the RR report as in the previous segment, to keep the student focus and use of the most recent data.  It was learned that there is no one single perfect fit, and it is important to evaluate the current assessments used, and to even look for new that may fill gaps, (Assessment Connection Grid) and help keep goals in line  Using the assessment Connection Grid can help adjust, keep things goal and age appropriate, and perhaps help with independence and self advocacy, that are necessary attributes towards ultimate career goals.


We can engage others, parents, regular educators, personnel, etc. in similar ways to the Allison case study in which included a school parent survey, in which in her case raised some potential concerns that may not yet be realized by the student at center.  Another aspect is to include even regular education teacher feedback in forms of surveys, etc.  It is also a good idea to have a regular education teacher in both IEP meetings and transition plan itself, as to broaden the data from different class vantages!

Now, after almost 9 years in education, I have learned that to be more effective, I need to ensure that the student's future goals, preferences, and interests are at the forefront of all IEP conversations.

Some ways that we can ensure that transition assessments are aligned to to students' preferences and interests are by having multiple data points and creating a portfolio of transition assessments, per se. It's important to have up-to-date data and align students' academics, electives, services, activities, and goals that will steer the student in the direction of their post high school plans. The IEP team can review data from formal and informal surveys/quizzes that provide a snapshot from more than one moment in time and they can ensure the student is placed into courses that align with their goals and interests. That way, not only will courses align, but goals in reading, math, and writing, for example, can be addressed via those courses.

At our cyber school, we have Career Readiness courses, portfolios for every student that have all transition information (thank you guidance!), Xello activities, and teacher-made surveys/assessments. When students share their preferences, future plans, and dreams, we can get them from where they are now to where they are going. Transition assessments change over time in order to keep them engaged. What is offered one year will change the following year because our services and activities are specific to grade levels and the focus changes over time, especially ass students get more specific about what they want to do. We want to make sure to assess what we actually need/want to know and not just give a random transition assessment for no reason or just to check a box.

We can include the rest of the IEP team by sending out parent/guardian transition surveys, encouraging them to have conversations with students about post-secondary plans, use their career evidence pieces in IEP team discussions, etc. It is important that the whole team stays in communication, not just during the annual and revision IEP meetings, but throughout the year to ensure students are supported to meet their goals.

The best way to support the on-going engagement in transition assessment is to collaborate with related service providers, school staff, and outside agency staff by educating students and parents about the transition process at the building level and specifically discuss what type of supportive programs and transition resources are available to students.  For example, I always invite the special education transition coordinator to students' 9th grade IEP meetings. It is always helpful and comforting to put a name with a face and helps the TC to establish a rapport with students and parents. The TC and I discuss various work-based learning opportunities that are available to students.  Often times this discussion leads to students and parents opening up as to what they want their child to ""try.""  

For example, if a student knows they want to enter the workforce directly after graduating from high school to work either in retail or the food service industry, we can discuss and provide job shadowing or work-based learning experiences in each of these career-interest areas in order for the student to get a better ""feel"" as to what each industry is like and make a better, more-informed decisions as to where they want to obtain employment after graduating from high school.

There are many ways in which we can support others during the transition process.   To me, it is very important to be open and honest about a student's skills and abilities.

For example, a junior who has clearly defined career outcomes would not likely be given a preference assessment, but a student turning 14 might be given this type of survey.
What are some ways we can include and support students, parents/family members, school personnel engagement in the transition assessment on-going process?

One way to engage all team members is to have open dialog during the IEP meeting to ensure every understands the purpose of both formal and informal assessments. I feel that team members are more likely to contribute to the process if they have an understanding of the ""why"" and the desired outcome. A variety of viewpoints and perspectives also help to capture all aspects of the students. Each member of the team has valuable information to share including the student.

"459","","It is very important for MPSGs to be aligned to preferences, plans, and dreams. In order to achieve this, members of the student's IEP team (student, parents, services providers) should all participate in collection of informal and formal transition assessments. Student and parent surveys can be used to determine if the student and their families are on the same page for postsecondary goals. These informal surveys can also help point case managers in the right directions for choosing other informal or formal assessments to gain a deeper understanding for the student's future goals and how the school can help the students achieve these goals. Informal and formal assessments should not be a one time thing. Student's interests develop and change over time. It is important for these assessments to be given often. We should not just take what a student and their parents say at the beginning of the 8th grade year to guide all future transition discussions and IEP decisions until the student graduates high school. Informal and formal assessments build upon each other and can be used to guide the team to other assessments in order to narrow the scope on how to best support the student. - Kirsten Kalista

We can ensure that transition assessment results produce MPSGs that are aligned with student preferences, future plans, and dreams by choosing appropriate assessments, i.e., select assessments that focus on areas that are aligned with what a student wants for their future.

For example, if a student indicate on one assessment that they enjoy working outside but on another assessment the student indicates that he has no outdoor working skills, we would need to get some clarification on that particular item. Also, simply asking the student what they think about whether the MPSGs fit in to their goals and interests goes a long way to ensuring student investment in the transition process. As long as the student is able to communicate, he/she should be able to indicate whether these goals line up with their own. We can support students by checking in regularly with how they are doing in classes or activities related to their areas of interest.  It is also helpful to provide a list of resources to families that will allow the student to explore their interests outside of the daily school setting.  For example, if a student expresses interest in working with animals as a career, perhaps knowing local shelters that need volunteers would give students an opportunity to explore that particular interest.
