IEP Alignment


If an IEP is not aligned, a student will be less likely to meet goals and close their academic gap.  If a student s IEP lacks goals or the goals do not match up with the child, several things can happen.  First, there is nothing for you to measure progress by.  There would also not be a specific goal for the student to work towards, or for the teacher to track progress on.  The team members will not really have an idea on what skill is being focused on and it will also be extremely difficult for others trying to follow the IEP to give the correct accommodations to help the student meet their needs.

- The student must want to achieve the goals for their own purpose.  When we listen to them and their own ideas of their post-secondary goals and align their education in a way that sets them up ro succeed in their own goals, we see student interest in their own education peek.
- Some of my students want to take college level coursework that may interfere with the regular school day.  By aligning flexibility into the schedule, this becomes possible.  However, without the goals, this may not have been a possibility for them otherwise.

First, there are certainly legal issues that could arise in relation to being out of compliance and due process laws.  Secondly, and more importantly, the students themselves are not being given the education they need.  Their needs are not being met in any area (academically, behaviorally, functionally, etc.) This causes problems because students may not be able to meet their current short term goals, but also are faced with difficulties in meeting their long-term future goals because they are not being given the skills they need to meet their transition and post-secondary goals.

Some possible outcomes when an IEP is not aligned include the following:

- Lack of interest or involvement from the student Post IEP meeting.
- No plan in place for how to get the student from where they are and where they need to be. Therefore the student may struggle to reach their goals.
- When the students needs are not considered in creating student goals this may also affect the students ability to reach their goals. 
- If the students annual goals are not aligned with the post secondary goals, the student may demonstrate difficulty to meet their post secondary goals.

Having an aligned IEP is, like the speaker said, a road map. Every part of the IEP must flow together. Reevaluations (and evaluations) give us needed information about student needs and strengths. Using them and data we collect, we can then address the best way to support the student.    Transition goals should be kept in mind when establishing SDIs. How will we get students to where they need to be to reach these goals has to be a factor, not just what they need now.

The alignment of an IEP is similar to the alignment of the human spine. If someone has a spine that is out of alignment they will more than likely be able to complete most daily functions, but will do so uncomfortably and possibly not to the best of their abilities. The same can be said for the effect an out of alignment IEP has on a student's educational experience. The student will probably be able to float through the day, but they won't be functioning at their optimum rate. For an IEP to properly serve a student and provide the desired outcomes, the components of the IEP must align, as well as the associated network of professionals responsible for implementing the IEP.

When a student's IEP is not aligned it is possible that the voice of the student is not heard/considered. If the student participated in interest surveys/assessments but those surveys are not considered when completing the transition grid and the measurable annual goals, the voice of the student is not represented in their transition plan. Another possible outcome may be that the transition plan for the student is not representative of that student's strengths and needs.

When you take apart a clock, you have the minute and hour hands, maybe a seconds hand, the gears in the back, the battery, and the clock face. An IEP works in the same way. Teachers must look at the reevaluation report and the strengths and needs of the student based on his/her disability. The reevaluation report should provide the background knowledge to writing the IEP and continuing the student's story, rather than being disjointed. Disjointed parts of an IEP don't convey a clear message. You can have all the information, but if it's not put together and connected, it is not effective and does not function properly.

An IEP that doesn't clearly take a student from Point A to Point B will not serve the student while in school, and will certainly not serve the student upon graduation. As the video mentioned, families could come back to the school and question the educational benefit for their students via due process.

The bottom line is that the IEP tells a story, and without telling a story properly, people get lost in the details and it doesn't turn out well. The IEP must be well-written, connected, and aligned to ensure that the team focuses on the student developing the skills necessary for post high school.

If an IEP is not aligned, the student may not be prepared to meet his or her post-secondary goals. If it is not aligned, students may receive inappropriate supports or miss out on services or opportunities that would be beneficial. It can also cause students and parents/guardians to be confused. IEP team members must have appropriate communication so that everyone is on the same page. Students also need to be actively involved in their IEP process.

Sam Carroll - Bedford Area,"Sticking to the script is how I view an aligned IEP.  The script is the original evaluation and the recommendation from the psychologist.  Over the years, IEP teams veer off the path and lose track of the actual disability and begin supporting things that don't need supported and begin working to unrealistic goals.  Support services, academic tasks, transition services, and goals all need to be aligned in support of the disability of the student.  For example, a student doesn't need a computation support of use of a calculator when they have a reading disability.  Regarding transition services, very few districts at the high school level have transition classes or time built into the academic schedule for transition services.  Therefore, aligned IEP's are more effective and efficient not wasting time that we don't have when offering transition services.

It is too easy to get caught up in the present, especially with a student who does not have clear interests or a meaningful career goal.

Having an IEP align is extremely valuable for a student and their success. Having real time data on a students strengths and areas of growth are crucial. It helps to understand what abilities the student possesses and what their areas of need are. From there developing appropriate goals that will enhance their deficits and assist with their goals for after graduation.

During the video the example given was in regards to a small group of the IEP group making decisions for the whole group that centered around the student attending a technical school for a field that she was not interested in essentially wasting a year of time. Students who are already behind their same age peers could possibly fall even further behind with each miss alignment made in their IEP. Another possible outcome when an IEP is out of alignment is that the student has not been exposed to programs or resources related to their interests and goals related to what they want to do upon graduation.

If the RR/ER does not match the student’s needs in the IEP proper goals and accommodations may not be created for the student.  Without the proper goals and accommodations the student may not be able to reach their academic and/or post secondary goals.

Students may experience goals (and therefore, individualized teaching) that does not assist them in gaining the skills necessary to reach their post-secondary goals.  This could lead to the student feeling unsuccessful in their chosen area of post-secondary training, leaving the student to no longer enjoy the area or wanting to change to another post-secondary field. Students may experience too much support in post-secondary training for areas that they demonstrate strengths in and waste time not targeting areas of need.

IEP alignment is an important aspect of IEP writing. Having students take an active role in IEP development, using their educational strengths and needs, interests and goals is a way to ensure that we as teachers are creating a document that will help guide them through their secondary schooling process, and help give them support for after  their secondary schooling. Making sure that goals align with their needs. A lot of special education teachers use a ""cookie cutter"" IEP, and do not create a personalized document that helps student make progress and be successful. It is important to make sure that we are doing our jobs to align everything within the IEP to ensure our students can grow and have success. If things like SDI's, goals, accommodations and modifications are not aligned to the student the are being written for, students can struggle to reach their goals, have success in a general education or co-taught classroom, or even learn skills and tools that will help them after post-secondary education.

There are many possible negative outcomes when an IEP is not aligned. Students may not receive the services that they would need to help them to be successful in the classroom. This can then transfer to their post education career. Students may be pushed into classes which they may have no interest in. If they do not have an interest in pursuing a particular career, but are made to take a class specific to that career, they may not do their best. This may include not doing their work, which may cause them to not pass the class. This may then lead to a negative attitude towards school.  As an educator it is important to have the documents aligned so that we can provide our students with the best possible transition from school to careers.

A poorly aligned IEP can have affect a student and how they reach their goals for after high school.  One result is poorly written IEP's.  A poorly written IEP may not include activities that the student should complete during one particular year which in turn can affect how they reach their goals.  Also, there may be areas of needs and activities in the IEP that may not pertain to the student and their interests.  So, a poorly aligned IEP can lead to students not prepared to meet their post secondary goals.

The presenter answered this question very well.  The worst thing we do when IEPs are not aligned is waste the students's time.  When we write IEPs for the sake of writing the document without giving them the attention they deserve, we are disregarding the student's goals and their areas of interests, strengths, and passions.  A student could very easily get caught up in the flow of the ""system"" rather than having the system help them reach their goals.  They won't be prepared to pursue a realistic and well-matched future.

When an IEP is not standards aligned, we will see a disconnect in the expectations and the students' achievement. If the goals are not aligned, they can become unobtainable or inappropriate. This leads to years of a student feeling unsuccessful. It could also lead to a breakdown in communication for the IEP team.

One possible outcome of a poorly aligned IEP could be failure to focus on the appropriate transition needs due to poor data collection, identification of needs and failure to utilize all necessary parties.  An example used in the video was placing a girl in a cosmetology program instead of placing her in a program that would be interesting to her (i.e., child care).  This was done due to a couple of professionals making decisions about this student.

When an IEP is not in alignment, there is poor communication between teachers, student, and guardians.

I like to think of the alignment as meeting the skill deficit, the need of the student. This idea, based on the collection of data, drives that  need to be addressed as a Measurable Annual Goal. If just those 2 pieces, Needs and MAGs,  are out of alignment -  what the student actually needs to have them access Education and to benefit from it will suffer. Then add in the Transition Grid...... When that MAG is not included as a service on the Transition Grid it is not connecting a critical piece of instruction that must happen for the student to work towards achieving their Post Secondary goals.
This disservice creates a break in the types of support the student is Entitled to while in school. The more difficult part of life beyond graduation, and Eligibility under ADA is yet to come and connections have not been established. This gap could result in Due Process, but I think more importantly it is just bad teaching. Students deserve better.

"","Todd Merritt - When a student's IEP is not aligned, it can cause many issues, not only for the student but also for the school district who is writing the IEP.  Some of these issues include, students not receiving appropriate training and education for their desired goals, students being put in classes they are not interested in, and students not being ready for life after high school.  These are just a few examples of the problems could be if a student's IEP is not written well and appropriately.

"","Since the IEP should be one cohesive document, if the sections are not in alignment several things can happen.  Two of the negative outcomes include: poorly written IEPs possibly leading to due process, and poor communication among the IEP team.  However, arguably the most impactful consequence is that students do not receive the services that they need, and in turn, are not prepared to meet their goals for life after high school.  The effects could far outlast the duration of the IEP and have very detrimental consequences for our students.-- Amanda Caton

When an IEP is not aligned, that means that the members of the IEP team are not working together as a team and ultimately the IEP fails to accomplish what it is designed to do. When there is a lack of team work the various parts are not cohesive and the IEP falls apart leaving the student to pick up the pieces of the IEP and work with individual aspects instead of an encompassing single IEP. -Tara J.

"","It is important to make sure the RR/IEP is aligned because if it is not aligned, there could be gaps. These gaps could interfere with transition plans after education. Appropriate assessments/goals have to be provided to ensure a student is fully prepared for next steps once graduating. It is also important that all areas are aligned to ensure students have been provided and have mastered all skills required after graduation. - Julie Bowman

I've always liked to describe IEP Alignment as the ""common thread"" running through the entire IEP.  If one aspect of the IEP is not aligned, the IEP itself can unravel.  When supporting teachers in our Local Districts, I remind them of this flowchart:

"","Adrienne Stiteler- IU 28:  When an IEP is not aligned, it becomes a document filled with incongruent information.  It leaves the reader of the IEP with a variety of questions.  The plan for the student is not clear, the needs are not clearly-defined, and the action steps to lead the student to successful post-school outcomes is not existent.  The IEP becomes more of a puzzle piece, trying to decide what is needed. A clearly defined IEP is one with clear, consistent data, identified strengths and needs, a meaningful transition plan with MAGs that support successful outcomes of the PSGs.

Mike Kass - AHCCS,"As mentioned by others, an IEP that is not aligned puts the LEA in a situation of non-compliance. Anytime where the classification does not align with the needs of a student and the supports they should be getting is an obvious concern.
What I have always found helpful was the advice to develop the IEP to tell a story. Anyone who reads the IEP should be aware of the student's current age, grade, and classification. The opening paragraph in the PLAAP lists their transition goals which serves as the end result to which the IEP is built around. The PLEP sections indicate where the student currently is regarding performance. The transition grid indicates the activities and supports the student needs to meet their goals. The annual goals align to the areas of need/concern that the student will need to strengthen in order to meet their transition goals. The SDIs / placement support the student in the area of need/concern to help them meet their MAG which will help them meet their transition goals. It should all flow from where we are now and how do we get to where the student wants/needs to be at when they graduate.
