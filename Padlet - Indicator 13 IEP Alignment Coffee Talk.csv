There are numerous obstacles both teachers and the student at the center can endure, if an IEP is not properly aligned.  I was reminded of the importance of using the RR, as it comes into direct play with keeping alignment for the student using the most current strengths and needs of the student.  Without student centered current data the IEP can be poorly written, disconnected in portions, cause poor communication with all educators making efforts to implement them, and simply lead to an incorrect map and limited or undesired choices down the road.

Anna Berzins- Achievement House Cyber Charter School,"When an IEP is not aligned, the team loses sight of students' post-school goals, there are communication deficits, and it ultimately leads to student failure.

Every part of the IEP should be filtered through the lens of transition. Team members must keep student career and post-secondary goals at the forefront as they discuss the IEP as it relates to academics and transition. Without having a conversation through the lens of transition, students will not be set up for success post graduation. It is especially helpful for students to take part in the meetings to ensure their voice is heard. The team should focus on the hard and soft skills that the student needs to develop for their career.

The IEP is supposed to tell a story. An effective story is one that has a clear beginning, middle, end, and has a distinct plot. Though there are many more elements to a story, the analogy remains. Every part of the IEP must point to another part and further explain what was addressed in a previous area. All parts work together like the parts of a clock come together. When you take apart a clock, you have the minute and hour hands, maybe a seconds hand, the gears in the back, the battery, and the clock face. An IEP works in the same way. Teachers must look at the reevaluation report and the strengths and needs of the student based on his/her disability. The reevaluation report should provide the background knowledge to writing the IEP and continuing the student's story, rather than being disjointed. Disjointed parts of an IEP don't convey a clear message. You can have all the information, but if it's not put together and connected, it is not effective and does not function properly.

An IEP that doesn't clearly take a student from Point A to Point B will not serve the student while in school, and will certainly not serve the student upon graduation. As the video mentioned, families could come back to the school and question the educational benefit for their students via due process.

The bottom line is that the IEP tells a story, and without telling a story properly, people get lost in the details and it doesn't turn out well. The IEP must be well-written, connected, and aligned to ensure that the team focuses on the student developing the skills necessary for post high school.

Over the years, IEP teams veer off the path and lose track of the actual disability and begin supporting things that don't need supported and begin working to unrealistic goals.  Support services, academic tasks, transition services, and goals all need to be aligned in support of the disability of the student.  For example, a student doesn't need a computation support of use of a calculator when they have a reading disability.

When the IEP is not aligned, it will ultimately lead to deficits in the student's skills. Any number of outcomes can happen when the RR and IEP are not aligned, including inappropriate goals,  wrong or missing SDIs, wrong educational placement, missing related services.

The IEP needs to be aligned with the most current reevaluation report. The information taken from the RR needs to be in several of the sections within the IEP.

Having an IEP align is extremely valuable for a student and their success. Having real time data on a students strengths and areas of growth are crucial. It helps to understand what abilities the student possesses and what their areas of need are. From there developing appropriate goals that will enhance their deficits and assist with their goals for after graduation. Often times this can be challenging because of a lack of communication amongst staff or not having up to date test scores. This is especially challenging with not having been in a brick or mortar setting for almost 2 years.

Student and parent/guardian input must be gathered at least once every year to serve as active participants in the student’s transition plan.

Dr. Heather Hibner,"An IEP is a road to life after high school and therefore the easiest way to think of that is through an analogy of a straight path. An effective IEP that is aligned can be thought of as a clear and unobstructed path that has student interest, input and strengths at the core. At the end of the path is the post secondary goal which is to be a successful adult after high school. IF the IEP team is doing its job, the student will traverse one milestone at a time over the course of their years in high school towards their future goal. If the IEP is not aligned, then miscommunication, goals that are not student- centered, and transitions that make no sense are the result. These things delay progress for the student and can hinder their future success.

IEP alignment is an important aspect of IEP writing. Having students take an active role in IEP development, using their educational strengths and needs, interests and goals is a way to ensure that we as teachers are creating a document that will help guide them through their secondary schooling process, and help give them support for after  their secondary schooling. Making sure that goals align with their needs. A lot of special education teachers use a ""cookie cutter"" IEP, and do not create a personalized document that helps student make progress and be successful. It is important to make sure that we are doing our jobs to align everything within the IEP to ensure our students can grow and have success. If things like SDI's, goals, accommodations and modifications are not aligned to the student the are being written for, students can struggle to reach their goals, have success in a general education or co-taught classroom, or even learn skills and tools that will help them after post-secondary education.

There are many possible negative outcomes when an IEP is not aligned. Students may not receive the services that they would need to help them to be successful in the classroom. This can then transfer to their post education career. Students may be pushed into classes which they may have no interest in. If they do not have an interest in pursuing a particular career, but are made to take a class specific to that career, they may not do their best. This may include not doing their work, which may cause them to not pass the class. This may then lead to a negative attitude towards school.

A poorly aligned IEP can have affect a student and how they reach their goals for after high school.  One result is poorly written IEP's.  A poorly written IEP may not include activities that the student should complete during one particular year which in turn can affect how they reach their goals.  Also, there may be areas of needs and activities in the IEP that may not pertain to the student and their interests.  So, a poorly aligned IEP can lead to students not prepared to meet their post secondary goals.  This is why it is so important to do informal surveys, a transition survey and a college readiness survey prior to writing an IEP each year.  Students interests change and we need to show that as we write their IEPs from year to year.

IEPs need to be student centered and focused on outcome desired by the student. I have seen too many cookie cutter transition grids focusing on academic annual goals rather than what we can do for that student as an individual.  If the IEP is not aligned, looking at the whole student, time may be wasted on activities not crucial to post secondary outcomes.

I like to think of the alignment as meeting the skill deficit, the need of the student. This idea, based on the collection of data, drives that  need to be addressed as a Measurable Annual Goal. If just those 2 pieces, Needs and MAGs,  are out of alignment -  what the student actually needs to have them access Education and to benefit from it will suffer. Then add in the Transition Grid...... When that MAG is not included as a service on the Transition Grid it is not connecting a critical piece of instruction that must happen for the student to work towards achieving their Post Secondary goals.
This disservice creates a break in the types of support the student is Entitled to while in school. The more difficult part of life beyond graduation, and Eligibility under ADA is yet to come and connections have not been established. This gap could result in Due Process, but I think more importantly it is just bad teaching. Students deserve better.

What I have always found helpful was the advice to develop the IEP to tell a story. Anyone who reads the IEP should be aware of the student's current age, grade, and classification. The opening paragraph in the PLAAP lists their transition goals which serves as the end result to which the IEP is built around. The PLEP sections indicate where the student currently is regarding performance. The transition grid indicates the activities and supports the student needs to meet their goals. The annual goals align to the areas of need/concern that the student will need to strengthen in order to meet their transition goals. The SDIs / placement support the student in the area of need/concern to help them meet their MAG which will help them meet their transition goals.
