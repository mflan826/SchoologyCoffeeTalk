Anna Berzins- Achievement House Cyber Charter School,"Students' measurable post-secondary goals (MPSGs) have to align with students' transition plans. The best way to ensure they're aligned is that students are actively involved in the IEP process and transition planning. It is our job as case managers to guide IEP conversations with qualitative and quantitative data to guide students into the best path for them once they finish school.

The MPSG's should clearly align with students' post-secondary, employment, and independent living. These should change from year to year as students change over time, based on student preferences. The IEP should make connections from the present education levels to the transition level, to the measurable annual goal, as appropriate. All parts of the IEP should work together like the parts of a clock, as I mentioned in a post for a previous module.

Students should have plenty of opportunities to explore their interests, while also understanding their strengths and weaknesses. If they have an interest in a certain field, but don't have the strengths necessarily to achieve that career, they can be guided to adjust their goals to something realistically attainable. That does not mean that the IEP team should discourage the student's hopes and dreams, but rather set them up for success and helping them determine a career path that may be better suited for them based on their current abilities. When students complete transition surveys, complete job shadowing, conduct interviews, apply for jobs, and have plenty of opportunities to explore transition planning, there will be more alignment and they'll have a better understanding of themselves as they make future transition plans.

Dinah Lapp - Juniata Valley School District,"It is important to always remember the individual in which the MPSGs are being developed for when actually developing this portion of an IEP. Students need to be able to share their preferences and interests before, during, and after these meetings to ensure that it is their individual needs being met. This seems like the most effient way to be certain their needs are being considered and met. Revisiting these ideas each year as they develop can allow the team to understand the change and relevance of the individuals ideas and preferences. When an idea is offered that is unrealistic as a goal, it is important to fall back on the students strengths and need to begin developing a more appropriate goal.

"Justin Walter, Jamestown School District, Gary Kinnear (LEA)","A student's MPSGs should always align with his/her preferences, future plans, and dreams. A way to ensure this occurs is to collect data on the student. He/she should always be involved in the process and their interest and strengths should be reflected in their MPSGs. I believe it is very important to give students exposure to many different experiences so that they can form an understanding of what they would like to do post-graduation. This can be accomplished through career center visits and other community based experiences. I believe it is also important to make realistic goals when forming them with the IEP team. Utilizing all the tools and data collected on the student should help create goals that will provide an environment for the student to be successful in. If an IEP team member believes the student's goals or expectations are too high or too low I believe it is crucial for the team leader to review the progress of the student and what the data says about the student. Every goal and expectation should be data-driven and geared towards the students strengths, interest, and progress.

A few key ways we could ensure students' MPSGs are aligned appropriately for the individual future include the natural updates of the re-evaluation and IEP processes.  Keeping things current and age appropriate continue in all phases.  Keeping the student front and center is once again important, as it is mentioned we need to ask the student “What are you ready to achieve right now?”  We need to know this as we set measurable goals to aid the student in the right direction.  Continually using updates with available assessment data is also necessary!


Some ways we can help all involved (students, parents / family members, school personnel ) that have unrealistic goals or expectations include steering others towards matching the positives to build upon. We can also work together to strengthen the support for appropriate matching realistic goals, that will in turn help with other self advocacy skills,  including more natural confidence if goals are appropriate and realistic.  Looking together as a group and weighing the pros and cons (to not be negative towards others invlilved) is also important.  Making sure students voice is at center is again vital.

Gathering transition information from the student, parents, agencies involved and the other members of the IEP team help to ensure that the post secondary goals are being addressed and worked towards.

Module 5 Coffee Talk,"Autumn Kosanko- Special Education Teacher at Connellsville Middle School. Our LEA is Nick Damico

One way to ensure that goals are aligned with a students future plan is to do informal and formal assessments each year with the student and their families. As their future goals and plans change, so will the alignment of the IEP. For those students and families who have unrealistic goals, providing them with data from grades, state assessment, aptitude and achievement tests, teacher input forms, etc  will help to show them that they want to make sure that the goals are attainable. For example a student in 10th grade reading at a first grade level and wanted to go to medical school to become a doctor is not a realistic goal. If they enjoy helping people and want to help people who are sick maybe being a nurses aide is a more attainable goal. The team will need to discuss goals that is in the interest of the child but yet is attainable at the same time.

To ensure that Students MPSG's are in alignment with their future plans and dreams, it is necessary to have the student's input. This is the student's future so their desires must be at the forefront of the plan. Data needs to be used to look at the strengths and abilites of the student. Exposure to different job shadowing opportunities would also be benificial to the student. Some times exposure to different careers can help a student decide if the career is something they would like to pursue, as well as, helping the student realize what they do not want to pursue. When dealing with unrealistic expectations, it is important to provide the results of the different assessments that have been used to drive decisions in the past. Conversations need to be ongoing to provide the best plan that the student's transition will be a success.

To ensure the students’ MPSGs are in alignment with their preferences, future plans and dreams, it is important that the IEP team collects data using multiple forms of assessment about the students’ interests, strengths and goals that they have for themselves involving education, employment, and future living accommodations. 


In order to help students, guardians and school personnel visualize realistic goals and expectations for the students’, the IEP team can explain the cumulative data collected on the students’ interests and strengths that could emphasize the students’ potential for reaching specific goals. The IEP team could also expose the students to different possibilities for future education, employment and living accommodations so that the students and guardians are aware of the possible paths the students can take in order to be successful after graduation.

There are several ways that we can ensure that student's MPSGs are in alignment with their preferences, future plans and dreams. First, we can make sure that we properly assess them and review the information with the student and the team. The team should then formulate the goals based around the preferences of the students. 
Also, we need to make sure the student is an active participant and their voice is heard. If the student had difficulty with communication skills, the team should be sure to utilize other ways the student can express their desires for their future. 


It is always helpful to engage outside agencies so that they can portray realistic opportunities to the students and their families. They can assist the families in finding the right fit for that child while also assisting them in reaching their desired goals. The agencies can also assist the team in having the student and/or their families go to places that will allow them to actively see their future choices.

For example, I have a student that has stated that they want to be a pilot in the Air Force. An easy first step is to take the practice ASVAB. If deficiencies are noted, the student has a tangible piece of evidence moving forward. The results help fuel the conversation of whether or not it is a realistic goal.

In order to be sure that student MPSDs are properly aligned with their preferences, the most obvious and effective way to do this would be to have open, honest, and continuing conversations with students and parents about what they would like to do.  If students are not actively involved in this process, any goals and plans created will not be achieved.  

If students have a goal that may be unrealistic, it is essential to strike a balance between being honest and providing alternative choices but also being supportive.  Data and assessments can help with this honesty.

Creating well aligned MPSG for students is an important part of creating an IEP to help students become successful during and after high school.  To help create these, the IEP/ Transition team needs to keep in mind the student’s preferences, future plans and dreams and also the data that has been collected from the multiple assessments, surveys and interviews.  Each year as the student works through the transition activities and as new data has been collected these goals should be honed to better fit the students future goals, creating a plan for future success. 
When students or guardians create unreal goals and expectations, it is the IEP/Transition teams job to help alter this goal into a obtainable future goal.  This is done through discussions based on the students data collected from all areas, including interest surveys, transition interviews, transition surveys, career surveys, apetube assessments, etc.  In these discussions the student's dream must not be crushed, but other options to explore and reasons why they may be a good fit can be discussed and explored further to help the student and guardian better align their dreams and goals with reasonable expectations.

In between the update,  different age appropriate assessments, informal inventories, open discussions, and research on what they want to do and what they are good at should be done often- as exposure changes as the year progresses.  In this way, we can make sure that we have open discussions about both realistic and unrealistic goals and helping to distinguish between what is a career (worth bringing in an income) and what is a hobby (worth bringing in entertainment and enjoyment) in ones life.  Teaching a student how to get to their plan A, maybe by going though plan B/C (such as a junior college vs a 4 year right out of high school) gives them a pathway that is both realistic and attainable. Exposure to job shadowing also helps to increase interests and or eliminate a career that the student has in mind and has blinders on without seeing related careers.  This helps with parent input forms and communication with the family as information is continuously gathered throughout the year or the students high school career.

The assessments which are given should be appropriate and accurately assess each segment of the transition section of the IEP (Employment, Independent Living, Post Secondary Training).  These assessments should be combined with information received from feedback and input from staff, students, and family members. When discussing goals and expectations that may be unrealistic, it is important that you have a two-fold approach.  First, it is essential that you should always address these conversations with a supportive tone.  Second, it is critical that every piece of information, suggestion, or guidance you make about goals is supported with data and student work samples.

I often come across students with unrealistic expectations. Many 8th grade boys want to be in the NFL, NBA, or professional rappers! When this happens we often change the focus of the discussion to why do you want to do these things? Are there other careers related to this one? We will try to discuss options that are related to sports, just in case they can't be a quarterback in the NFL.

Some of the ways we can ensure that the goals are measurable- choosing transition surveys that align with the students age/grade. Reviewing what the student wants to achieve after high school- this should be done at least once a year. Planning for MSPG depends on the goals of the student- if the student is unsure of what they would like to do, it's important to use goals that will help a child decide/review the different options they have. When the goals seem too high/low for the student's ability its important to review what will be expected if the student chooses this way- IE let students try a college level course while in high school to see if this is something they can do.

Unfortunately, there are many cases where unrealistic goals or expectations arise.  For example, a student wanted to become a social media streamer and gain income from the social media provider and subscriptions from the viewers.  To become a successful streamer, one needs time and patience to gain the following needed.  So, I discussed with this student as with all of my students that in today's job market, it is wise if not vital to have a back-up job option (or more than one back-up job option) as they work towards their long-term goals.  I am an example as I moved from a freelance sign language interpreter to a Teacher of the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing, to a mental health counselor, and then back to a Teacher of the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing.  Job security is not a guarantee.  Many unrealistic or lofty goals can be investigated while a practical option is prioritized for the immediate future.  If a student has lower expectations, I often provide activities where a student considers the actual income received each month on the job they would like alongside typical bills, taxes, transportation costs, food costs, and other expenses to evaluate if this is the type of lifestyle they would like.  Often, this provides natural feedback that creates an interest to pursue more challenging or worthwhile options.

We can help team members with unrealistic expectations by being honest and empathetic. I have had luck managing student expectations in our individual sessions, as opposed to in front of the whole team at an IEP meeting. Again, having a solid relationship with the student works wonders in this situation, as they can trust we would not steer them wrong/out of their dreams. I think the same idea would work with parents or other team members, as people often respond better to individual discussion than group.

During the transition planning process, it is important that the students’ MPSGs are aligned with their preferences, future plans, and dreams. To do so, it is important that the student is involved in the planning process. They must be an active participant in their own transition plan.

There are also ways educators can help students, parents, and team members who have unrealistic goals/expectations. I liked how the video talked about always being supportive. Even if the student’s goals seem far-fetched, it’s important to always be supportive. One way is by presenting various jobs/careers that they can explore based on their interests.

Some ways to ensure alignment is to be sure to keep the focus on the student's preferences, future plans, and dreams. Keeping the focus of what the student wants to do clear aids in keeping appropriate perspective when planning. 

Ways to support the team with unrealistic goals or expectations is to to discuss what the team can do to successfully achieve the short-term goals.

One way we can ensure to make sure the goals are not unrealistic is to stress to the team what are you ready to do and able to achieve right now as well as that the goals are reviewed yearly. I also really liked the 3 bucket analogy presented to include what jobs and careers to explore, how and where the student wants to live and to determine what additional education and training are needed.  This will help to keep the goal centered and also steps to achieve the particular goal areas.

Having unrealistic goals or too high/too low expectations can be daunting for students, parents/family members and school personnel.  Working and communicating together is key.  For that student who dreams of being a professional football player, video gamer or YouTuber, they may just not know what different types of jobs are out there in related fields.  So it may take time to educate, inform, or coach students about a career path or job where they have no prior knowledge.  That's where transition resources come in to play.  Have students take an interest survey annually.  Their interests and preferences may change from year to year. Educate them about the various career paths, including salary, and the amount or type of education and training involved for the jobs/careers that students are interested.  Provide them with statistics and data about the job growth and outlook.  It's important to be realistic, but also supportive and patient with students as they change their minds, grow and mature throughout their high school years.  The IEP case manager should document this information (discussions/activities/students' thought process and feelings within the progress towards transition goals.

However, the student's voice and plans carry the most weight in the discussion and planning.  The IEP is the pathway to follow in order to achieve career success after graduation.  The staff involved must be supportive of the student's goal even if it seems unrealistic. The teachers and career counselors may gently guide or suggest career choices that are in line with the student's goals if the goal is too far from reality.  Aptitude tests might be a good place to start with the teacher and the student.  This can also be a guide in which the student can use to determine a future career.

Many students we all have worked with before have unrealistic goals.  Many want to be rapper, pro athletes,... but in all reality, these goals can not be attained.  However, as educators we can look at these goals and see what the student could do that could still have some component of the goal they have.  If a student wants to be a pro athlete but does not have the physical capability for this, there are other avenues that they could take.  Maybe a para-athlete is more practical.  May the have good writing skills and could write for a newspaper for the sports section.  Maybe they could work in a sports arena.  There are many ways that we as educators can look at a career and look at our students and find a way to combine the two.

Transition assessments are useful to allow the student to have involvement in this process. These assessments/input forms will allow the student to think about what they want to do in the future and possibly research what exactly that future goal would involve (i.e., future education/training, moving, living away from family, etc.). 
 
Unrealistic goals/expectations can be addressed by having discussions with the student/family. I would not say directly that the goal or expectation is unrealistic or unreasonable, but having a discussion where the requirements of said goal are discussed and explored would be useful for opening dialogue to let all members of the team feel confident about if the goal is attainable and ultimately what the student wants for their future.

Parents also have a key role in helping students realize their goals for after high school so their input and feedback is essential. Students should complete transition assessments every year so that their MPSG’s are aligned with their desires and plans. Since MPSG’s are geared toward life after high school, one needs to consider the 3 areas in the transition grid- Employment, Post-secondary schooling, and Independent living. Assessments can be used as data when speaking with parents and students about MPSG’s and student post-secondary preferences. Using assessments will help us ensure that student goals align with their abilities, dreams and experiences. It also aid us in developing the steps needed to help students achieve their MPSG’s, based on where they are now.

As with any conversation with parents of students in special education, highlighting student strengths is essential to building and maintaining rapport with families, and this is where the conversation should start.

"","To ensure students MPSGs are in alignment with their preferences, we have to use the results of the transition assessments (both informal and formal) to help create the goals.  Students completing these assessments will have more of an investments if the goals are related to their interests.  If a student has a goal that is unrealistic, there are several things that can be done.  For example, we can ask why the student likes the career, what is interesting about that career for you.  It might be that a student wants to work with children and the only career they know is a teacher.  Exploring other careers that relate to the student's interests, we may find a more realistic goal. - Marissa Jacobs

In talking about Measurable Postsecondary Goals and ensuring they are in alignment with a student's preferences, future plans, and dreams, I feel assessment is crucial.  If a student has an unrealistic goal, we cannot be ""dream crushers,"" in that it's not our job to say someone cannot do something.  This being said, we also cannot push a student along and say they can do something that would be unattainable.  If we utilize assessment properly, a student can then see where their skills are and what Postsecondary outcomes would align with those skills.

"","Adrienne Stiteler- IU 28: The MPSGs should be an exact reflection of the assessment data that has been gathered and reviewed with the student.   If a student wants to pursue an unrealistic expectation (too high or too low), we can assist them by looking at a variety careers in that area of interest.  By looking at all of the requirements, guide the student (and family) through the decision-making process.  Like any student, after taking a deeper look into what will be required of them (i.e. length of schooling, moving away from home for that occupation, demands of the occupation, etc.), they may change their mind or they may not.  It is just really important to have that conversation and provide them with an array of options that meet their area of interest.

"","Amy Smith, IU6: Use the data gathered from informal and formal assessments to formulate the MPSGs to align with the student's preferences, future plans, and dreams. We can assist students, families, and school personnel by using the data gathered and introducing related careers/occupations that better suit the student's skills. As Matt Flanagan used the analogy of the moon and the rocket: you may not go to the moon, but you might work on the rocket that takes people there. We need to connect the student's skills with their preferences, future plans, and dreams.

"","The more the student and parents can drive this section, I believe the greater the chance for success. I really like the ending statement in this section stating just that. When expectations are not aligned to what the Educators in the room may feel is a realistic expectation, then I think that using the activities to have the student and parent explore ""reality"" is a good step. And along with this, having the Case Manager follow up to see where things stand to update/revise the IEP. When possible, updating/revising the IEP for Transition points the family to reality, especially if they are reluctant to move in that direction. Melinda Krebs IU 12

"","Documenting strengths, needs, current tasks that student is able to do throughout present levels, especially when discussing transition, would be helpful in aligning students' MPSGs and expectations for the future. This allows for the remaining members of the IEP team to see where exactly the student is at in terms of what their individual expectations are and whether or not they should adjust them. This is obviously very much easier said than done. Alyse Watson

"","Using a student's interests and preferences, along with their skill sets, you can help students to determine their future goals.  Asking for information from parents or family members can also be helpful.  Giving students many opportunities to job shadow or learn about many jobs that relate to their skill sets and interests as well is a huge help.  If a student is interested in becoming a veterinarian, but maybe can't handle all the schooling/reading/science involved, he/she could be shown some of the other jobs out there surrounding working with animals.  -Misty Harris

"","Taking a critical look at the transition assessments and making sure that there is match with the student's MPSGs.  If the student's assessments say he is interested in becoming a mechanic and has an aptitude for that area, then does his MPSGs match that career area?  In terms of unrealistic goals, ""I want to be a professional football player"", what other ways can the student be connected to sports other than being a professional player?  Maybe it is coaching/being a referee, maybe it is working at a food stand within the stadium, maybe charting plays, maybe video/technology person and making sure the equipment is working and maintained, maybe broadcasting/announcing games, writing a sports column for the local newspaper, etc. - Brian Kritzer

Mike Kass - AHCCS,"As mentioned in the video, the IEP should tell a story of where a student is and where they want to go. If a student shares that they want to be a veternarian, but are struggling academically, I would explain to the student/parent what the data currently shows and how that relates to the data for the occupation of choice. For example, at AHCCS we use Acieve3000 which measures a student's lexile and presents articles to them at their lexile level. I will tell a student that a vet. has an expected lexile level of 1420L and the student's is currently at 570L that if the student want to be a vet. than they will need to improve their reading levels. I tell them that if this is something you really want, then you are going to have to work even harder to accomplish it. If a student/parent changes their mind about an ambitous career goal, then we can discuss career options that may be less academically demanding.
