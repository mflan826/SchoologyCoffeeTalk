All of the student's IEP goals should reflect these goals, and it is important to be clear and transparent with students about all aspects of their IEP so that they can advocate for these goals.

Being at the Middle School seems to be where the focus increases on transition planning.  It now makes more sense from the video, I didn't realize 6 pieces are to be added of the 20 in their 8th Grade Year.  I believe we have trended in that direction strongly.  In terms of what I believe I do to engage youth and and families is keeping with the ""Student Centered Approach""  I enjoy listening to the results of surveys and the students commenting when we get to that point in the IEP meeting.  I always try to add what I observe positively that may help students have more confidence in what they are starting to show excitment about.  With many of our students it is all about confidence, and if you can offer a positive praise on a specific skill or attribute, you may find the parents chiming in with ""he does this at home well too"".  This opens communication and helps all involved with the process!

My school is an one year program so it is extremely difficult to process all students and  engage students and families in the transition process in a timely manner since we are supposed to process around 50 students from scratch in around four months. Having said that, it is important to get input from students/families. At the beginning of the processing, we interview each student to get their opinions on their strengths, weaknesses, career aspirations and goals for the year. Using this information, we are able to best support the students in class and try to prepare them for life after high school. It's important to get as much information from the student since they're ultimately going to be the one pursuing their own goals. Since students at my school are 18 - 21, it has been a real struggle to get parent feedback/input regarding students. Often times, I have to rely on information from old IEP's. However, in an ideal world, I would get information from parents and would be able to use them as partners to create the strongest possible plan. It's their kid and they know their kid best so the more information they give and the stronger we are as a team then the stronger the plan would be. Collaboration and input from all members are most important to creating a strong plan.

For transition to be successful, I agree with others that first students need to be aware of their disability and how it impacts their learning. Once they understand why they have an IEP and what it is used for, they can then become more involved and realistic in planning for their future.

Being flexible is also important for the team members as students change their minds on their career interests as they grow up and get closer to graduation.  Being able to support the student during these changes is also key.  


As a 10th -12th grade Learning Support Teacher, Transition planning is very important for my students.  Due to being a small district, we wear multiple hats, so I also work with our 7th-9th grades learning/emotional/life skills/and Autistic Support students.  This gives me the opportunity to be involved in all the student’s future goals.  We as a district, start preparing students for life after graduation as early as 6th grade.  Students come to the high school end of the building with having already completed some career benchmark requirements.  Once they enter middle school and become 14 years old, we work closely with each student and their families to ensure we are gathering information and helping provide opportunities and resources to the student and the families.  We don’t have a lot of hands on opportunities in our small town, so parents are often able to help get students to job shadowing opportunities, tours, hands on experience, etc.  If this is not an option, then teachers will often step in and take the students.  Successful transition planning requires constant reassessing of the student’s desires, views, wants, and needs.  Students and parents are involved in the IEP/Transition process as soon as the student reaches 14 years of age and continues as long as they are in school.

Since the planning involves post-secondary outcomes of what the student plans on attaining for education, career opportunities, and activities for independent living; it is vital that the student is involved throughout the process. 

Transition planning should be a ""team"" process. What each team represents, can change depending on the student's interest and needs. Of those team members, some can include: OVR representative, other community shareholders, parents, student, counselors, transition liaison, and other members that represent the best interest of the student.

Moreover, transition planning should not be a ""cookie cutter"" process or just another part of the IEP document. It should be best suited around all of the students current interests and outcomes and include as much information that would help them with planning for the future. 

Within our district, we engage youth and families with the transition planning as early as middle school, to make them aware of the many possibilities that are available to them as they get older. During this process, many families are unaware of all of the possibilities and resources that exist within their communities.

In my opinion, OVR should come to the table sooner in most cases to assist with transition planning as there are often many barriers involved in supporting students...

Families usually have not only support to add to the student's plans, but also help the student consider their strengths and weaknesses and people who know them best. Once a transition plan has started to mold, it is then important to be sure to incorporate any supportive services (OVR, supports coordination, service coordination) that may support the student and family following graduation.

Knowing and having a relationship with both your student and their family builds for a strong foundation for a successful transition plan. When developing a student's transition plan I like to start with a transition survey for both the parent and student to see what their goals are for after graduation. From there we develop activities to support those goals. During the 4 years of high school we gather data in a variety of ways to see if their abilities support these goals or if taking a different direction is needed. (Examples: career assessments, Community Based Assessments, strength explorers, etc.) Data can also be gained through student's involvement in career and technical education and through their academics. 
Collaboration with all parties is also needed. This could include teachers, various agencies, OVR, school staff.
Like someone previously stated, each plan will be individualized to meet the students needs and successfully obtain their goals for after graduation.

The strengths, needs, goals, and preferences must all be taken into consideration during the development of the transition plan. Age-appropriate assessments completed across different contexts, courses, services, and activities should all align with the student’s path to their post-secondary goals.  The entire IEP should be based on the student’s transition goals leading to a results-based plan. It’s essential to engage youth and families in the transition planning process through frequent meetings with their school Guidance Counselor, Transition Coordinator, Special Education Case Manager, service providers and teachers. All students should be working on a working portfolio that consists of activities and services that will lead to their post-secondary, employment, and independent living goals. The student and IEP team must update the transition plan at least once per year and decipher what courses, services, and activities are appropriate for the school year to assist the students in developing the skills needed to be successful after high school. OVR should be discussed at all IEP team meetings and invited to transition planning meetings with parent/guardian consent.

We are required to engage in the community in some way with a community service project, and we are encouraged to complete job shadowing with an individual working in an area we are interested in.

The importance of providing transition planning opportunities and services to eligible students is the process of developing and coordinating opportunities to foster both individual and economic growth.  Like other LEAs, the Warren County School District (WCSD) engages members of the IEP team in the annual IEP ‘discussion’ regarding transition planning and data collection.  The District takes advantage of transition planning by ensuring all stakeholders understand and embrace transition planning beyond the IEP record.  Over the last five years, the District established annual goals to progress transition services and programming in our school community.  Most recently the District opened a transition service program – the STRIVE Program.  The STRIVE Program incorporates the Practical Assessment Exploration System (PAES) and provides students with opportunities to engage daily Social Interaction, Transition Planning, Recreation and Leisure Activities, Independent Living, Vocational Learning &amp; Exploration , and Employment Skills.  The District will continue to expand transition services to include work based learning experiences, supported employment, and competitive integrated employment.  


Our transition programming engages all members of the IEP team and allows the team to gather necessary evidence to support planning services and opportunities for each child.

The Transition Planning should be flexible as students will most likely change their mind about their goals for the future.
   Conversations regarding transition planning need to occur more than once a year at an annual IEP meeting.  We need to be connecting the students and families to outside agencies and programs that will support them as they move into adulthood.

Without a plan, students are planning to fail after graduation, and we need to take steps as a school in order for that not to happen. It is essential that we give students the opportunities to explore career options and discuss post-secondary education options. Aligning the IEP to tell a story and help students get from Point A (where they are now) to Point B (where they want to be after graduation) is essential.

Engaging youth and families in the transition planning process is crucial. A few ways that I currently engage students and their families is via parent/student surveys, course assignments that are career-related, conversations about post-graduation, among others. As a case manage in a virtual school environment, I have a Homeroom course where I post activities for students to complete as they plan for their futures. Parents/guardians are invited to complete surveys about their hopes and dreams for their students and the supports they think their child may need. Families are encouraged and reminded to attend IEP meetings, where the focus is post high school graduation. Students complete learning inventories, personality profiles, and career matchmaker activities. They participate in English discussion boards about important skills needed in their future careers and are asked to ask questions and interact with peers on those discussion boards.

To do this discussions with the student, parents, guidance, teachers and any agencies that are involved with the student career planning.  The student’s academic and special education team needs to do interviews, and  data collection from different sources (grades, aptitude tests, ASVAB, inventories, etc). Before writing the IEP the special education teacher needs to help students understand and analyze the data that has been collected through discussions and activities.

This is done through positive relationship building, facilitating consistent, concise, and clear communication, promoting strong family involvement, and utilizing other key personnel within the educational/career programming. It's essential that students have the knowledge needed to be successful and are given the chance to participate in decision-making opportunities that are being made about their life. Therefore, increasing and improving self-advocacy skills, will allow students to provide experiences in developing knowledge of their self, knowledge of their rights and responsibilities, as well as increase their communication and leadership skills. The overarching goal is to provide all students with access to preparation for meaningful engagement in Post-Secondary Education and Training, career pathways, and becoming a responsible citizen.

Transition planning is student centered.  All goals should reflect the student’s identifiable measurable goals, focusing on academic and functional achievement.  
Transition planning is a team approach. School personnel, OVR, other appropriate agencies, students, and parents need to work together to make the transition planning the most effective. 
Students need to participate and actively answer questions about their future pertaining to the three main transition goals: post-secondary education, employment, and independent living. 
Our Transition coordinator will engage our students by having them complete transition surveys.  I offer the students extra support in completing the surveys by sitting with them, because I want to know about them and I want to know what they would like to do after graduation.  
To engage families,  I ask the parents questions in regards to goals they have discussed with their child, if they need any further assistance in reaching out to any additional resources.   In addition, I engage the families by telling them what their child has informed me about transition goals and discuss the steps involved.

The process explores students interest and helps students have meaningful pathway for a successful transition into adulthood.

From a young age i have always discussed with my students different community roles and the skill set required to take on these roles. I have completed fun activities with my students such as ""When I grow up I want to be...."" I would always ask the students why they chose what they chose and what skills they have already that would make them successful doing that job. I have recently moved to a new school district where I now have students in a Life Skills K-6 setting. It has been truly eye opening the relevance of these activities, starting the students at such a young age of kindergarten, now having students in 6th grade ready to transition over to the high school next year. There are two things that I have found have made a huge impact in my classroom with my students. The first is having a solid home and school connection. Having communication with the student as well as their family's input as to what their goals are for after high school makes a huge difference in the foundation of transitioning into the ""real world.""  The other thing that I have found makes a huge difference for my students is the Coffee Cart program that I run in my classroom. This program allows me to introduce many different jobs including greeter, server, stocker, barista, cashier, custodian, accountant, clock manager, manager, and assistant manager. I have each student rotate through different jobs to determine which skills are needed for each and where the students feel most comfortable. My students are still currently learning positions and experiencing team building strategies on what it is like to run a work place, but they are very excited to eventually roll out the program and start delivering coffee. I believe this gives them a strong feeling of pride and indepence, knowing that they are capable of participating in this program they will also be capable of participating in a job experience when they graduate.

Parents are involved during the meetings by explaining the exploration that will take place during the 7th grade year.  At IEP meetings we give parents contact information for our transition coordinator so they can make connections at any time with the agencies available.  We also write transition goals together with the parents so they can assist their child in exploring the careers they choose.  It is so important to include parents in the early stages so the students can participate in as many activities as possible while in planning stages of their future.

Successful Transition planning has many aspects to it. You want to provide the instructional and related service support for the student but equal to that - the connection to community experiences and local Agencies that will support the individual after graduation. 

The Post School Outcomes for each student should be at the center of the IEP. How will the ""WHAT"" we as the Educator are doing support the student in achieving their goals? And while providing this instruction and community experiences and connections there is also vocational assessment taking to consider.

The HOW does this happen depends on the student and each Case Manager but includes: job shadows, having the OVR Early Reach Coordinator present Pre- Employment Training classes, personal calls to parents, e-mail follow-ups to remind people to connect to agencies and giving student opportunity to practice Self-Advocacy skills. These individualized experience may include volunteering in the community, at school in a work setting or internships. And all of this is advanced if the school district Special Education folks are able to network through Transition Council, other local employment centered groups, the S D Career to Work Coordinator and create partnerships for successful outcomes for their students.

Goals established by the team are not only measurable, but monitored at intervals to determine if students are making progress.  Transition planning should also make it a priority for students to develop career skills that prepare them to interact with others without disabilities.
Youth and families play an integral part in ensuring that career preparation activities take place.  In considering student interests in strengths when transition planning, students will feel motivated to participate in activities that are individualized to them.  In also considering parent and guardianship involvement, these IEP team members may have a greater glimpse of interests outside of school that can be integrated and accessed in career development.  By involving them in the conversation and the progress monitoring of the goals, all team members can ensure that students are actively participating in career preparation.

I believe that a crucial component of successful transition planning is getting to know a student as an individual, separate from what is documented in compliance paperwork. While it is important and necessary to familiarize oneself with a student via ERs, RRs, and IEPs, I have found that when students come to me in 9th grade, the reality of who they are in person is very different from who they are on paper. Personal interaction can’t be overlooked, and it begins the process of getting to know the student’s interests, hobbies, future plans/goals, which can also give me a glimpse into skills that a student possess that are transferable to an employment setting. For example, if a student tells me that he/she enjoys building with Legos, I then understand that the student has a certain level of fine motor skills that would generalize to certain areas of employment (packing, sorting, manipulating smaller objects, for example.)  In addition to getting to know a student, I also contact family/parents/guardians to converse with them about the student, including similar topics (e.g., interests, hobbies, community activities, volunteering opportunities, goals/future plans.) The familiarization process is what I consider the informal / observational part of initial transition planning, and from there I start the formal aspects of transition planning. Formal transition planning involves administering employment/vocational interest surveys, student interviews/checklists, and parent/guardian/family input/surveys/inventories of observations pertaining to the student. As part of engaging the family in the transition process, I begin the OVR’s pre-vocational / Early Reach application process. ~ Kat Llewellyn

"695","","As a 7th and 8th grade teacher, I am usually the first person engaging the students and families in the conversation about transition planning. I feel it is important to remain up to date and informed on the process and resources available both to educators, families, and students. At the young age of 13 and 14, I am used to hearing students say they have no idea what they want to do after high school. Often times the students and parents feel overwhelmed thinking about post secondary goals since it still seems so far away. Engaging families in this conversation through surveys and educating them on resources available is crucial. Setting the stage for transition planning in middle school will help with the process as students enter High School. Communicating this with the High School staff is important so they know where each student and their family stand on transition planning.

"743","","It's very clear when reviewing files through the CMCI process that there is more work to be done when it comes to Secondary Transition to allow LEAs to demonstrate compliance. The biggest thing that I'm currently seeing is the lack of assessment data within the present levels section which would really help the IEP team create post-secondary outcomes. Working towards gathering information on the ""whole student"" would really be helpful for teams to know how to set their students up for the most successful outcome once they leave their doors. Marrying compliance and best practice so to speak. Alyse Watson

"744","What makes a good transition planning?","Dianne Keller, Elizabeth Forward School Dist.

Good transition planning begins with the student and his/her family.  What does the student want and what expectations does the family have for their child? A student will be so much more likely to pursue an interest than something he feels is a waste of time or something he can not do. If the family is on board with the student's interest, this supports the student in his pursuit of employment.

"745","","In my role it is important that LEAs help their IEP teams understand exactly what is required to demonstrate compliance.  It is nice to know what the other agencies have to offer, and some best practice ideas for a robust Post Secondary Transition program for special education students, but if the LEAs cannot demonstrate compliance by completing the special education forms I must review for their monitorings, or which my colleagues must review during complaint investigations, there isn't much point in talking about anything else.  Debbie Sotack

"746","Adam Mitry / Philadelphia Electrical & Technical HS , LEA","Good Transition goals involve communication with both the parents and the students. We use the CareerScope battery as well as a questionnaire given to the student. Data collection should be gathered not just from a formal source, but also from the student. As an example, if I am working with a student and he expresses a desire to go to college, follow up questions should be asked. This is especially important as children change their goals frequently.

"747","","I think the person centered component of transition planning is extremely important.  Really hearing and making a commitment to helping students reach their dreams and life goals is key.  It really all starts with the transition assessments and gathering information to determine students strengths, preferences, interests, and needs.  Prior to the meeting, have the student think about how he/she can contribute in his/her meeting.  Maybe it's having the student share what he/she is good at or what he/she like about school.  Start of small and keep building on how students contribute in their IEP meeting.  Brian Kritzer

"748","","I think it's very important to look at all aspects of the student from interests and preferences to skills the student has to skills the student is still working on acquiring.  Youth and families are invited to meetings, as well as given information about activities that may be of interest to them. - Misty Harris
