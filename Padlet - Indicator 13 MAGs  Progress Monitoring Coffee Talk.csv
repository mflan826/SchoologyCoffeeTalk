Lori Stish - Hazleton Area School District - Mr. Jeffrey Weed- LEA,"It is important to engage families in the development of measurable annual goals because the family may want a particular skill for their child to be successful with. Sending home, a parental survey before the annual IEP is helpful in determining what goals to develop. It is important to start with a baseline and then you get to see the progress the students are making. It also helps you to decide that if along the way you may need to modify and/or adjust the goal by adding an intervention. IEP meeting are very intense but encouraging and having the parents participate in goal develop can ease the process.

Setting independent research goals, goals for leadership and time management help my students prepare for college and their career paths.  Discussions with their families while planning these goals help my students to understand why they are important.

James Flick - AHCCS/Trina Knauff,"A good strategy to start with is to review the student’s baseline date and progress for academic, function, and transitions needs, with the student, parents/guardians, and IEP team. This helps all members of the team understand how the student is achieving currently for in academic and functional need areas. The review should also the student’s progress from the previous year to inform the determination of goal criteria for the current IEP.


Another strategy is to maintain an open line of communication. Parent/Guardians and the student can be engaged by sending home input forms to gather input on the strengths and weaknesses of the student.


Leaving time during the meeting for the family and/or student to give their feedback and concerns is another strategy I have seen work routinely. This helps foster agreement and make sure there is consensus on the IEP for the student.

In order to get student involvement in the development of measurable goals, I go over assessment results with the student. After identifying areas of strength, we talk about possible areas for improvement. For example, if the student did not score well in fractions, long division, and solving algebraic equations, we talk about which is most important to the student's interest in becoming a welder. Since fractions are essential in reading a tape measure, we decide on fractions as an area for an annual goal.

Mike Lewis - Quaker Valley SD,"Here at QV we work to create, keep and maintain lines of communication with all stakeholders when it comes to developing measurable goals.  We start by gathering the input of the students and families that we are working with and develop goals from there.  That line of communication remains open so that when a student meets a goal or finds that they are struggling to meet a goal, communication is established and can be ongoing.  Making sure that considerations to change a goal are shared with all is key.  All stakeholders in a student's IEP need to have the opportunity to share insight that supports making a change during the year and leading up to the yearly IEP meeting.

At the beginning of the year, I make sure to contact all of my families either by phone or email. I also send home a “Million Words or Less” paper which asks the parent to tell me about their child. This gives me insight into their strengths, weaknesses, and other pertinent information. I also send weekly emails to parents which provides any important information that they may need to know along with a list of missing assignments. This keeps the communication open, and parents are aware of what is going on in the classroom.  By starting to communicate from the beginning, we are familiar with each other. When it comes time for the IEP Meeting, we are not strangers. This can help ease any doubts the parent may have.


It is also important to have open communication with the student. Having a good rapport with the student helps in many ways. Once they feel comfortable, they are willing to work with me. Being able to talk to the student about their hops and dreams leads to the development of measurable annual goals.


Data collection is also needed. Before the goals can be written, a baseline needs to be identified.  The goals should be written to help build on what the student may be lacking in. The data should be listed in the Present Levels. When I progress monitor to collect the data on their goals, I make sure to explain why they are working on a certain skill.


Transition information, teacher input, and student/ parent input are all ways that parents and students can be apart of the development of their goals.

Both students and families need to be involved in the development of measurable annual goals. The students need to be aware of how their needs are connected to the development of their goals. Teachers can engage students in the development of goals by meeting with students,  explaining their goals,  and explaining what students need to do to meet their goals. Furthermore, progress on goals should be shared with students. 

Families also need to be aware of students' goals, how progress is measured, and when students meet goals. This is accomplished in IEP meetings and through progress monitoring reports each quarter.  Families  can also  provide valuable information to the IEP team about needs they see at home that impact their child's school progress such as time management, study skills, self-advocacy,  etc. In this way, families are part of the goal development.

Collecting data from multiple sources is the first step in creating measurable Annual Goals.  This data comes from progress monitoring, teacher data from observations/ assignments/assessments/ interviews, parent interviews/surveys, and also student interviews and surveys.  After the IEP team has sorted the data and created an easily understandable form, it is then taken to the parents and students to discuss with them the child’s greatest needs, the goals and how they will be monitored.  Informing them of the data collected allows them to ask questions, provide more information and be part of the collaboration during the goal making process.  This helps the student understand their baseline and the goals they have helped set.

3.Parent interviews:  discuss their observations, share the accommodations, supplementary aids and services - what is working, should be added or taken out based on student need.
Taking all of that into consideration along with other members of the IEP team, using professional judgements, student strengths, weaknesses and needs, create goals that will enable progress.
